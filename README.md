# TBL-Edit

Place the required files in a "Tbl" folder in the repository's root folder. This folder is on ignore in Git. The output files will go to a "TblNew" folder next to it.

Currently required files:
- ColorShift.tbl
- en-US.bin
- HookAsset.tbl
- HousingDecorInfo.tbl

Copy all the tweaked files from "TblNew" to the world server's tbl folder, and copy the .tbl files to Data/DB in the client's folder. The .bin file goes straight into the Data folder.
This Data folder should be placed at NCSoft/Wildstar/Data, with Wildstar.exe being at NCSoft/Wildstar.

A tweaked Wildstar64.exe will be needed, in NCSoft/Wildstar/Client64. Get this file from arctium.io, Downloads page -> Wildstar -> Client Modifications -> Wildstar64_16042_CustomFiles.zip

When all this is done, you should be able to use new decor items and decor color shifts.
