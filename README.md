# TBL-Edit

Place the required files in a "Tbl" folder in the repository's root folder. This folder is on ignore in Git. The output files will go to folders next to it.

Currently required files:
- ColorShift.tbl
- Emotes.tbl
- HookAsset.tbl
- HousingDecorInfo.tbl
- HousingDecorType.tbl
- HousingPlugItem.tbl
- en-US.bin

Copy all the tweaked files from "TblServer" to the world server's tbl folder, and copy TblBeta or TblNormal directly into the Wildstar Data folder.
This Data folder should be placed at NCSoft/Wildstar/Data, with Wildstar.exe being at NCSoft/Wildstar.

A tweaked Wildstar64.exe will be needed, in NCSoft/Wildstar/Client64. Get this file from arctium.io, Downloads page -> Wildstar -> Client Modifications -> Wildstar64_16042_CustomFiles.zip

When all this is done, you should be able to use new decor items and decor color shifts.
